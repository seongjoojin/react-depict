# React-Depict

React-Depict is a VS Code extension that visually represents the structure and dependencies of React components. This tool visualizes the relationships between components in your project as an interactive graph, helping developers understand the structure of complex React applications at a glance.

## Key Features

- üéØ **React Component Dependency Visualization**: Display import relationships between components in an intuitive graph
- üîÑ **Component Type Distinction**: Visually distinguish between different types of modules like components, hooks, utilities, and constants
- üìä **Usage Statistics Analysis**: Get quick insights into component usage counts and dependency relationships
- üîç **Component Search and Filtering**: Find components by name and filter nodes by type
- üé® **Interactive Graph**: Support for clicking nodes, dragging, zooming in/out, and other interactions
- üì± **Detail Panel**: View detailed information, dependencies, and dependents of the selected component

## Technology Stack

- Powerful graph visualization using D3.js
- TypeScript/React project analysis
- VS Code webview-based interface

## Installation

1. Search for "React-Depict" in VS Code's Extension Marketplace
2. Click "Install"
3. Restart VS Code

## Usage

### View Complete React Dependency Tree

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run "React Depict: Show React Dependency Tree"
2. The React component dependency graph for your project will appear in a new panel

### Analyze Dependencies Centered on a Specific Component

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run "React Depict: Show Dependency Tree for Specific Component"
2. Enter the name of the component you want to analyze
3. A dependency graph centered on that component will appear in a new panel

## Graph Usage

- **Node Selection**: Click on a node to highlight dependencies related to that component
- **Node Movement**: Drag nodes to adjust the layout of the graph
- **Graph Navigation**: Use zoom buttons or mouse wheel to navigate the graph
- **Component Search**: Enter a component name in the search box to find specific nodes
- **Type Filtering**: Filter nodes by type such as components, hooks, utilities, or constants
- **View Details**: Select a node to display component details in the right panel
